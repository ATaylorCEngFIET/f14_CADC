INTRODUCTION
This paper describes the architecture of che CPU and Memory for the Central Air Data Computer (CADC) System used in the Gruman/ Navy Fl4A carrier-based fighter aircraft. The CADC performs specialized computerational functions in response to input stimuli such as pressure sensors , temperature sensors and closed loop feedback inputs Outputs from the CADC system are used to drive pilot visual displays (such a8 , altimeter temperature indicator, mach number indicator, etc : and to provlde control inputs for other aircraft systems _ The outputs from the CADC are in the form of digital and analog g1gnals . Figure 1 illustrates a block diagram  for the CADC _ Being in a flight enviroment meant that certain constraints must greatly reflect the architecture of the CPL and Memory. These constraints were size, power, real-time computing capability and cost, not necessarily in that order _ Other constraints such acceleration and mechanical shock affected the a8 temperature, overall design of the CADC . The size of the CPU-Memory was limited to a maxinum of 40 square inches _ This included the arithmetic section, read-only memory, and read /write memory _ Since the unit was to be packaged on a printed circuit card the number of layers of the P.c . card was an important consideration_ The power consumption had a limit of 10 watts at ambient 25'C . This was principally a function pf the capabilities of the Pac , card to withstand the heat . The required coputing capacity for the CPU was not defined at the beginning _ This meant that the system had ta be gomewhat Elexible to changes in computational load _ Qf course limits had to be set to be able to work within the other constraints _ What was known about the computation was the form of the equations to be implemenLed _ This included polynominal evaluations data limit-

ing, data comparison and discrete or flag inputs and outputs. Tbis meant that the arithmetic and logical functions pf the 8ystem had td handle at least the Eollowing operations: Multiply Divide Add Subtract Limits Square Root And Or Conditional Transfer Unconditipnal Transfer Recelve Discrete Data Receive Digital Data Output Discrete Data Qucput Digital Data The last constraint of cost wa6 certainly important since the system would eventually g0 into high volume production_
FUNCT IONS TO BE IMPLEMENTED Before we proceed, a better understanding of the functiong be implemented 18 necessary . The function that most often to occurred wag the polynomial, ) 6 4 2 F(x) = + a5*5 + &4* + 23*3 + 86% a2* + a1* + a0 where X was the input, either from outside the CPU (sensors) or from its OwTI memory . In order to save arithmetic time the polynomial was implemented in its "nested" Eprm 48 follows: F(x) = ((((((xe6) + 85) x + 24) X + 43) % + 82) * + &1) x,+ a0 The data limit function was one that would accept 3 binary an limit (I) a lower limit (L) and 4 parameter (P) . inputs , tpper } The output would then pe 25 follows; P if W > P > L L if P < L U if P > I

Early in the architecture study it was realized thac package size and quantity should be kept to a minimu if we were to meet the size constraints established: With minimum packaging space requirements it W29 necessary to use packages wich the fewest possible leads_ This would minimize the complex P-c. card interconnect which wab inevitable_ Because of this the processor wa8 designed to trangfer data Se rially throughout the entire system _

Before looking at the functions of each of these tnits 1 brief Look ab the timing is needed; Figure 3 illustrates this timing.

Every 20 congecutive bit times are defined 28 8 Word, The first bit time of a word 18 called TO, and the last time of che word is called Tl9. Two types of words are used in che system, WA and wo" In Ha ' the arithetical algorithms operate and instruction words are shifted serially into each functional unit_ In Wo; coputatlonal input8 and out- are Shifted serially among the units 4 word mark used puts to distinguish word times 18 2 8ignal coincident with Tl8 of every word time _ Two consecutive word times WA and Wo' 15 called an operation  (Op) time .

SysLem executive control bits 13 through 19 are assigned to control the processor modules The reason for having such a control is to minimize the storage requirements in the ROM' & by disabling their operation when they are not being uged.
SOFTWARE COMMENTS The goftware for this system 18 closely ag8ociated with the hardware arrangement _ To program such a sy8tem efficiently requires complete knowledge of the hardware, At the present time there 1s no asbembler avallable to properly handle Ehe multiple ingtruction Bet and data path considerations to yleld 9n efficient program, Present programing requires hand coding at the machine code level. This 18 certainly tedious but it resplts in a more efficient circuit interconnect and minimum total ingtruction words_ All of this reflects the number of arithmetic modules and ROM 5 necessary to handle 1 particular prob lem,
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES The advantages of such 4 system are determined by the constrint; under which system design was accomplished. The size of che circuit packages were guch tbat the original size constraint wa3 met. The sizes are indicated below :

The  flezibility of the hardware to adapt to a great number of problem statenenbg along with itg RO.M. reprogramming capa- bility i8 certainly 4 feature desirable in all systems of thig kind _ The fact that the software and hardware can be used in conjunction with each other helps to reduce the total parts cotnt in the system_ When total parts are redueed then power congumption and cost Mill be reduced. Fower consumption for the CPU-Memory

discuased in this paper exceeded the original 10 watts This wag due to the Large quantity oE read-only memory needed to implement the Prob Lem statement. With present day technology the cost of such a comerclal CPU-Memory system could be less than  $2000 in Iarge quantities _ Thig 1s based on 4 price of less than 865 Per cireuit type. The disadvantages f thi8 sy8tem 18 reflected in the software. To hand code che entire program in 1 nachine such a8 this 18 9 time conguming and tedious effort_ To u8e an aggembler or trans _ lator to perform the coding would result in 2 less efficient program &nd possibly more hardware. To obtain the minimal hardware configuration 2 person with both hardware and software knowledge of the syatem 13 needed _ Future designs of this nature meed to be worked closer with the goftware requirements in order to minimize the effort required for programing_
SUMMA RY 4 CPU-Memory system ha; been pregented that watisfied the requirements 0f a particular application_ The "pipelined" approach regulted in 1 system with enough flexibility to satisfy the present requirenent and to adapt to other areas of applica- tion_ MOS technology provided "state Df the art" power dis - sipaELons and packaging densitie: obtainable in no other wey. This system proved to be the most effective in meeting the given requirements_
