Supp Ix_ Voltage
Convent ional integrated circuits must be powered by supp ly voltages rang ng from 3 to 5 V , At these votages ) the des i gn of efficient power supp] ies that can provi de the required power is difficult_ MOS devices_ the on other hand, typical ly are powered by supp ly voltages rang ing from |0 30 to V At these vo] tages 2 supp ly des ign is easier and efficiency is higher. SYSTEM TIMING
The CADC system clock is a 5-MHz osci  lator Th i s is divided down to produce two clocks_ phase one (01 ) and phase two (62) at a frequency of 375 kHz _ One comp Iete clock period ( 62 to 02) is def ned as a bit time see Figure |-2) 9 which i s 2.666 Asec _ Every 20 consecut ive bit times are def ined as a word_ The first bit t ime of a word is cal led TO , and the last bit time of the word is called Ti9 Two types of words in the system are WA and Wo' In Wa? the parallel arithmet ical algorithms operate and control (instruc- tion) words are shifted serially into the units In Wo' computat ional inputs and outputs are shifted serially among the units A word mark used to dis- tingu ish word times is a s i gna | coincident with Ti8 of every word time_ Two consecutive word t imes , WA and Wo' is called an operat ion (OP) t ime. The tota] number of operations used in the CADC is 512.
To distingu ish the final OP  t ime, a frame mark is generated. This is a s i gna] coinc ident with Ti 8 of the final word time of the final OP_ The time between frame marks is called a frame, A frame includes one comp lete Compu- tationa] cycle.

When us ing the SL in a system, there are certain timing and propagat ion delay cons i derations_ These wi be discussed later under Software Sys tem and Cons iderat ions.
Electrical characterist ics and log i c diagrams of the SL can be obtained rom Source Control Drawing 9441|8 .
The SL contains 771 act ive MOS devices and has a chip s ize of 128 by 33 MILS, A photograph 0f an actua] chip is Shown in Figure T-[7.
Read-Only_Memory_ ROM"
PN 944425
The ROM operates as a 2560-bit random access/sequent ial access device_ It internally stores fixed patterns of 28 words of 20 bit Iength for seria] readout_ The patterns are spec i fied by the user. The format for the patterns is described under Computer Aids. The ROM has prov is ion to accept a 20-bit serial binary word address _ The first seven bits indicates wh ich of the 128 words is to be accessed, and the next three bits spec i fies_ 9 by manufacture mask decoding, wh ich ROM out of a possib]e ei ght ROM group should have its output enabled_ The present hardware imit for a ROM group is four. This i s due to Timi ted output buffer drive capabi Tity. )
The address management is accomp I i shed by a reg ister counter contained within the ROM, Thi s counter has the fol lowing capabi lity: (1) resettable, (2) S teppab le such that the memory can be sequenced through the I 28-word field, (3) accepts a retain address command and holds the present address , and (4) accepts a numerical input for independent address mod ifying or loading. To accomp / i sh the above address management_ s iX logi c nputs reset (R) _ ) retain, increment_ 9 Ioad , add , sub) and one address data input are provided. The Iogic of their operat ion is as fo] lows :

The R nput , on its negat ive trans t ion, resets the bits of the address register to all zeros. If the R s i gnal occurs during WAcc  it does not affect that data. The next state of the address counter is al1 zeros_ The R input wi 11 be coinc ident with Ti8_ The R nput win override retain, increment ) Ioad , add , and sub inputs_ The retain input holds the current address of the counter.
