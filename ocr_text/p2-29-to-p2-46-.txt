INFLIGHT DIAGNOSTICS
To detect failures of the processor circuits during the flight of the F-|4A airplane, an inflight diagnostic rout ine was programmed into the CADC, The ground rules for the diagnost ic routine were set up as being able to detect any s ing le failure due to the folowing:
(a) Each interconnect failure
(b) Greater than 95 percent arithmet ic unit failures
(c) 100 percent failures of nonarithmet ic circuits
(d) Timing and clock s i gna] failures
To sat isfy this requirement , the fol owing procedures were fo] lowed. First, a comp lete sing Te fai lure analys i s was performed on the PMU and PDU. The result of this analys i s was 5 sets of operands   (m and R, D and 2;) for the PMU and PDU. Each set of 5 operands detected greater than 98 percent of all s ing le failures. (See Computer Aids, Sect ion 3 . )
Next , these operands were programmed as test words into the program: The test words were initiated from ROM 5 and were transferred through various steering paths and RAS registers before they became operands for the PMU or PDU. The result (product or quot ient) was then again transferred through steering paths , RAS regi sters _ and SLF funct ions and combined with each other unti | a S ing le binary word was the result_ This binary word was then compared with a stored constant from the ROM. To ensure that the output of the did comparator not stick in the good" condition, a bad test was also performed to exercise the other state of the comparator_ The results of these tests were picked by the BITE c i rcuit ry. Drawing PA-|5409 shows the mechanizat ion arewckedfap the inflight diagnostic.
