Program Control ROM' s
Each arithmetic unit has an associated steering unit and RAS unit. This i s not an absolutely necessary assoc iation but was chosen to add flexibi ]ity to the programming. Figures -22 and 1-23 iustrate two other possibi )ities of circuit arrangements. It i s important to note that the hardware arrange- ment is flexible to the given prob em statement_ If many multip] ies are needed , then two or more PMU ' s could be used instead of One. The same can be true for any of the circuits.
The ROM' s are used in two different modes: the data ROM' s access data during the Wo cycle, and the contro] ROM 5 access data during the WA cyc le. The di fference be ing determined by wh ich t iming si gna] WA (for Wo accessed ROM' s ) or Wo (for WA accessed ROM' s ) is connected to the increment input to the ROM' s. The contro] word path for all three modules is connected as shown be low.

Data storage ROM' s can be treated Tike the outputs from the other circuits _ They are connected to the 1 nputs of the steering units_ The total number of ROM' s used in each group is a function of the total amount of storage requi red and the update rate of the system. The number of arithmet ic units i s a func- tion of the amount of calculation and the update rate of the system- As shown , the hardware is flexible in two directions: computational Ioad and update rate. This flexibi ity is required to handle the various types of systems to be imp lemented. Figure 1-24 iMustrates one method of a flexible hardware arrangement_ To ilustrate al hardware arrangements i s not usefuly possib]e. Each unique arrangement depends upon the programmi ng requi rements _
Since we have discussed the interconnect ion of the hardware circuits, a few computer operations can be discussed and how the circuits funct ion together described The fol owing operat ion sequence will be used in the discuss ion

FRAME MARK
BEGINNING OF COMPUTATIONAL CYCLE (FRAME)
The  frame mark s i gnal wi 1 set all ROM' s to their initial address _
During Xp the three groups of contro] word ROM 5 will 1' s imultaneously shift out a 2O-bit control word _ These control words win select the necessary data paths to transfer the appropriate data to become M, R, D , 2 , U, P, L, or data inputs to the RAS 's The appropriate RAS register will be selected s imultaneousIy _
During Wo/' al1 of the arithmet ic, RAS , and data ROM outputs are transferring data to the inputs of the steering unit _ Since the contro] words have already selected the appropriate data paths_ the data wil cont inue through the steering and back to the inputs of the arithmet ic and/or RAS units_
During WE the second set of control words are transferred to the A2' steer ing, RAS , SLF uni ts, and the arithmet ic unit s are per forming arithmet ic operat ions on the data transferred to them during Wo ! " Dur ing Wo2' the outputs , whether it be comput ed arithmet ic answers (product_ quot ient , Timit, etc.) or stored RAS data, are again transferred to the steering units
A comp lete cycle of fol lowing data through the processor circu its has now been accomp | i shed. This cycle is repeated 5/2 times in the F_I4A CADC and const itutes one frame Sys- tem programming must then be discussed i f meani ng - ful data are to be app] ied to the data that are be ing transferred around and through the circuits_ Section 2 wiml cover the software programming of the processor.

SECTION 2
SOFTWARE PROGRAMMING
The software for the F-|4A CADC essent ia ly cons ists of knowing how to organize and code the various contro] words to accomp ] i sh the appropriate data transfers _ To accomp ] i sh this , the des red mathemat ical equat ion should first be converted to a hardware oriented mathematical mode 1 and subsequent ly transformed to a t ime-hardware diagram; At this stage, the contro] words are ready to be coded. After cod ing has been comp leted , s imulation of the enti re Ioop veri fies the desired results. This section winl discuss in detail the above procedure and how to use it_ Figure 2-| shows the flow diagram 0f this procedure.
MATHEMATICAL MODEL AND SCALING CONSIDERATIONS
The system problem statement is defined in terms of mathematical equations_ An examp le of this is as the folow ing po] - ynomial
Input Y , Output E
3 E = 5 xi aj = Xaz + x2az + Xa + a0 = 3rd order polynomial 1 =0
where,
LZ + B
X
This represents a third order polynomial whose independent variable is con- di tioned (B) , expanded (c) , and Timited (LI , L2) Thi s  examp | e wi ]1 be used throughout the entire software procedure.
The math mode | shou ld be appropriately scaled such that no calculations wi exceed + (1-2-/9_ ) . These are the max mum pos itive and negative values obtainab]e in the processor_ A few rules that should be fo] owed when doing the scal ing are as fo] lows ;
(a) When adding or subtract ing, both numbers must be scaled to the same number_ The sum or difference wi11 then be scaled to this same number.
Example:
0.65 + 22 0_85

0.65 A
0.2 0_45 = A A
where
scal ing factor
Care must be taken such that the sum does not exceed +(I-2-/9) or the di fference exceeds -(1-2-/9). If this condition exists, it is called overf lOw.
(b) When multiply ing two numbers , the sca] ing of the product wi  be the product of the i nput scal ings .
Examp le:
065 0.2 043 X = A B AB
(c) When dividing two numbers , the scal ing of the quot ient wi] be the quot ient of the input sca] ings ,
Example:
0.2 A
0.8 0.25 = B A B
Care must be taken such that the scaled dividend (842 is A always greater than or equa] to the scaled divisor (%) If the dividend and divisor are equal in magn itude, then the divide algori thm wiu1 produce a max mum posit ive or maximum negat ive quot ient.
+A = +A
1-2-/9 = max +
+A = -A
(1-2-/9) = max
Now, take the origina| examp le and apply some scal ing factors to it.
Suppose, Output 0 < E < |0
Input
0 < Y < 30
Then the scaled math mode] might look Tike this.
3 2 i=0
E = 15

where,
L2 36 36 + B LL 36 36 18 = 2
There are cases where the scal ing might require addition of arithmet ic operat ions to the original math definitions_ The fo lowing examp le wi show this.
Suppose, '2) (Yal + X
If the above equat ion is used as is, then
+ X 20 4
Thi s would result in the invalid addition of two numbers with different scal- WY ing factors. A divide operation to rescale would have to be added 20 as shown_
28 X WY X WY + X + = + = 4 4 4 4 4 20
It must be remembered that all arithmetic results must a Iways be Tess than 1
MECHANIZATION DRAWING
After the math mode | and sca] ing i s comp lete, the next step wi 11 be to make a mechanization drawing: Thi s drawing transforms the mathematics one step closer to the hardware. The mechanization drawi ng is a step-by-step layout of the math mode | with blocks that represent hardware_ The priority of process ing the calculations or the intermed iate storage of data i s not shown on this drawing. Figure 2-2 shows the original examp le transformed to a mechanization draw ng_

Each arithmetic module (Figure 2-3) is shown as a row of 512 blocks_ 9 each block represent ing one OP time. The PMU modu le is on top with the PDU modu le in the middle and the SLF modu le at the bottom. Under each row of blocks are pos tions for 16 horizontal Tines , each Tine represent ing one RAS register, As data is stored from operation to operation, it is shown as a horizontal Tine extend ing from the operation that the data is written to the operation that the data is read.

Additional examp les from actual F_|4A CADC program are presented in the Programmi ng Examp les subsection. These examp Ies wil iHustrate the different funct ions and methods of programming. Section 3 (Computer Aids) wim1 discuss and show the computer program drawing, which has been drawn by a CalComp plotter.
CodinG
After the comp lete prob lem statement has been Iaid out as a computer program drawing, the next step i s to code the program into instructions or contro words_ The coding is presentIy performed in what is class ically called mach ine Ianguage. This is coding in binary that is directly usable by the mach ine. Coding is performed OP by OP for each modu le_ The code wo rds were previous ly def ined under SLF (Section | ) _ Figure 2-4 (a through g) shows the examp le problem coded onto prepared forms_
EXECUTIVE CONTROL
The executive contro] is used to contro] various parts of the F-4A CADC system: In general , it is used to contro] the 1 nputs (A/D, discretes) _ 3 the outputs (D/A, digital data, discrete), and the Processor.
The executi ve control cons ists of an associated group of ROM' S , supplying a 20-bit control word every operation time. Each bit has a preass i gned task based upon the hardware configurat ion. The ass i gnment for each of the bits is as fo ] ows :

(b) Simulation--The s imulation shou ld use this bit to step the discrete regi ster.
Execut i ve bits 13 through 19 are ass igned to contro ] the processor enable to and disable the assoc iated groups of contro] and data ROM' s _ The reason for having such a contro] is to minimize the usage of ROM' s the processor The association of the computer program drawing to the ROM' s is as follows :
If the mult ip]ier (PMU) module was used I00 percent of the ti me , the PMU contro] and data ROM S would have to be incremented every operation. This means that each associated group of ROM' s (control and data) wou ld be 5/2 times_ stepped This wou ld be 512/128 = 4 ROM' s for each assoc iated (28 ROM' s total for a]] seven groups) . o9rche Now suppose that only half contro] words and only half of the data words are needed sporadically throughout the program; Thi s would a] Iow two alternatives_ The first alternative wou ld be to ncrement the ROM' s each operation and to Mi pad" the words not used with zeros _ This wou ld provi de max i mum programm ing flexibi 1ity and maximum ROM storage. The second alternative wou ld be to prov i de an outs ide source that wou Id increment the ROM' s only when they are needed. Thi s wou] = d provi de min mum programming flexibi ity and minimum ROM storage. This is essent ially what the execut ive bits 13 through 19 do_ When a system is being cons i dered, a cons i derable number of ROM' s can be saved using this method. In the F_4A CADC , 14 ROM' s were saved at the cost of 4 execut ive ROM' s _ This is a total saving of 10 ROM' s Before actual imp lementation of a system, the system eng neer would have to make a tradeoff of programm ing flexibi ity versus ROM cost_
SOFTWARE SYSTEMS AND CONS IDERATIONS
As has been shown, the_software for this system is closely associated with the hardware arrangement _ Thi s fact i s related to two factors; (1) the flexible arrangement of the hardware and its interconnects and ( 2) the prosent means of cod ing by machi ne Ianguage_ The Tatter cou]d be el iminated by deve Iop ing a mnemonic Ianguage to aid the programmer of the system; The for- mer is an advantage of the system in that the SyS tem becomes efficiency adaptable to many prob ]em statements_

Software and Hardware Relat ionship
After the program mechanization has been comp leted, an estimate is made on how many of each arithmetic operation and Iogica] function must be per- formed_ From this est imate and the required update rate of the calculations_ the number of arithmet ic modules can be determined, and the interconnect of the hardware def ined, The most efficient way to determine this interconnect is to connect the circuits as the computer program drawing is made_ Th i s con- s ists of determining which circuit outputs are connected to wh ich steering inputs. As each data path is needed in the program, it is added to the inter- connect ion. When the program drawing is comp leted, the total interconnect win be comp letely laid out. Any 1 nputs to the steering that have not been connected are not needed and can be grounded. After this step is comp leted, the program drawing can be reprogrammed with the fi na nterconnect i f greater efficiency in programming and memory storage is des ired.
An important cons i derat ion when programming the processor is the propa- gat ion delays encountered when transferring data from c ircuit-to-circuit. As can be seen, the path the output data takes unti ] it gets transferred to an input is programmed; In the F-I4A CADC , the max mum t ime al lowed for this trans- ferring is the 6 2 clock time approximately 2.0 psec) The programmer that ma kes the computer program drawing must cons i der the Tength of each path he programs such that it does not exceed the width of the 6 2 clock_ The max imum al lowable delays out of, through, and into each circuit are isted in the source control drawing of each circuit_ The s i mulation discussed under Computer Aids , Section 3, provides a means of keep ing a cumulat ive total of the propagat ion delays for each data Path _
The software for the F-|4A CADC uses arithmetic and Iogical functions as fo] lows :

For the present hardware configuration, this represents about 50 percent of its total computational capabi Tity, i,e. max mum number of mult iplies is 512, max mum number of divides is 5/2 , etc. This capabi lity should not be confused

with the subject of programming f lexibi ity; As previously discussed, programming flexibi ity depends on the M1 pad" ocations in the ROM' s _
Suppose a module uses 3 ROM' s (384 words)_ If the program requires only 2-1/2 ROM' s (320 WO rds) 2 then it could be said that the hardware has capabi Tity for 64 more words Thus programming flexibi Iity is shown in the computer program drawing and how the spare 64 words are spaced throughout the program is ihlustrated. If they are at the end of the program, then minimum reprogram flexibility is avai lable because the executive words need reprogramming to make use of these spares_ If the spares are spaced Iogi cally th roughout the then program, maximum reprogram flexibi Tity could be obtained, thus requiring minimum executive reprogramming.
In this system, as in most cases , max mum efficiency and flexibi Tity can only be obtained through the comp lete knowledge of both the hardware and the software_ Programming ingenuity is a big factor if minimum hardware is the objective.
